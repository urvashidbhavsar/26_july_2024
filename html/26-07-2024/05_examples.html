      <big><b><code>HTML</code></b> and <strong>XML</strong> provide ways to reference Unicode characters when the characters themselves either cannot or should not be
        used.<u>A numeric character</u> reference refers to a character by its Universal Character Set/<mark>Unicode</mark> code point, and a
        character entity reference refers to a character by a predefined name.
